To develop a CNN model to classify images of plastic waste










📖 Overview
PlasticWasteClassifier is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based project designed to classify images of plastic waste into predefined categories. The goal is to assist in waste management and recycling by automatically identifying plastic types from images.

Key Objectives:
  Develop an efficient deep learning model to classify plastic waste.
  Contribute to environmental sustainability by facilitating plastic recycling.


📊 Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of images of plastic waste, categorized into different types for classification. The dataset is curated to train and evaluate the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model effectively.
